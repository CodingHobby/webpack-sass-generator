## Yeoman Webpack, SASS and ES6 Generator

This intends to be something to get you started on your ES6 + SASS Webpack project.

To use this simply run `npm install -g generator-webpack-sass`.
Once you've done this, you'll need to run Yeoman by typing `yo` and then select the generator, or simply run the generator with `yo webpack-sass`.
